Hello! I'm Linh Nguyen, a passionate Data Scientist with a track record of harnessing the power of data to drive meaningful change and growth in diverse sectors. Currently navigating the world of data at Oracle, my journey has taken me through tech giants like Amazon and critical health initiatives, such as the Vietnam Ministry of Health's Nanocovax Vaccine project.

With a knack for converting complex datasets into actionable insights, I have successfully utilized ML models in the healthcare industry, saving millions and optimizing surgical processes. In the tech space, my footprint extends to devising JIRA-enhancing tools for Amazon and implementing new functions into Native AWS products. These tangible outcomes were not merely a product of technical prowess but also a testament to my commitment to creating solutions that leave an impact.

Academic rigor at prestigious institutions like Drexel University and the University of Birmingham armed me with both a theoretical foundation and the leadership skills to guide and inspire. At Drexel, I not only excelled academically but also played a key role in establishing the Drexel Association for Data Science, aiming to connect students and professionals in this thriving field. Meanwhile, my time at the University of Birmingham allowed me to helm the Vietnamese Society, fostering a rich cultural exchange among peers.

Outside the world of 0's and 1's, I cherish the intricate art of crochet (please check my work [here](https://www.instagram.com/linhcorner/)). It provides a therapeutic contrast to my analytical pursuits and brings balance to my life. Crafting beautiful patterns, much like in data science, requires patience, precision, and a flair for creativity.

In the words of Steve Jobs, "The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do." I believe in this philosophy wholeheartedly and am constantly seeking opportunities where I can merge my expertise with my passion to make a difference. 

If you're on the lookout for a dynamic data professional with a penchant for crafting both code and crochet, let's connect! Whether it's to collaborate on a project, discuss the latest trends in data science, or just share crochet patterns, I'm always excited to connect with like-minded individuals. Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/linhpn0204) or check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/npl0204).

Looking forward to our paths crossing,
Linh.

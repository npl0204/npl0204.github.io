Hi, I’m **Linh Nguyen** – a Data Scientist at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/) with a passion for turning complex data into impactful solutions. My journey has taken me through **Amazon**, **Intermountain Health**, and **Oracle**, where I received full return offers from all.  

I've built **ML-driven healthcare solutions** optimizing surgical processes and saving millions, engineered **JIRA-enhancing tools for Amazon**, and contributed to **Native AWS product development**. My work is driven by a commitment to real-world impact, blending technical expertise with strategic problem-solving.  

Academically, I hold a **4.0 GPA** from Drexel University and a **First-Class degree** from the University of Birmingham. I founded the **Drexel Association for Data Science** to connect students with industry professionals and served as a **Dean’s Ambassador**, advocating for the student body.  

Beyond data science, I find balance in **crochet**—crafting intricate patterns with the same patience and precision I apply to my work. You can check out my creations [here](https://www.instagram.com/linhcorner/).  

Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/linhpn0204) or check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/npl0204).

Looking forward to our paths crossing,

♡ Linh ♡

      year: 2021.06-2021.12
      description:
        - Imported and pre-processed biological data of 13,000 participants into a SQL database and performed ETL process and exploratory data. 
        - Designed machine learning models to predict the hospital length of stay (LOS) during COVID-19 based on pre-admission features in different hospitals and to predict the total number of cases by day in Vietnam based on previous data in multiple regions. 
        - The LOS prediction model achieved 85% accuracy during pandemic’s peak period, assisting in changing hospital structure and management system, resulting in a decrease in healthcare-associated infection rate by 63% and an increase in hospital profit by 78% over 3 months.

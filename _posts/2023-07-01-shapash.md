I found this today, and I think this is very fun to try. [Shapash](https://github.com/MAIF/shapash) is a Python library designed to enhance the interpretability and comprehensibility of machine learning models for all users. Its primary objective is to provide various visualizations that present explicit labels, ensuring ease of understanding for everyone.

For Data Scientists, Shapash simplifies the comprehension of models and facilitates result-sharing. It enables them to easily interpret the decisions made by models through a summary of the most influential criteria.

Moreover, Shapash plays a significant role in data science auditing by offering informative insights about any model and data in a comprehensive report.

Additionally, Shapash allows the generation of user-friendly web applications that aid in analyzing complex models. This accessibility extends to both Data Scientists and individuals with non-technical backgrounds, such as field experts.

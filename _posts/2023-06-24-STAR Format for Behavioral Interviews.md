This is an example post with image galleries.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/10.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

The rest of the images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/12.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

Are you preparing for an upcoming job interview (I think it's the time of the year for this preparation lol)? 

The behavioral interview is where employers ask questions about past experiences and how you handled specific situations. These questions aim to assess your skills, behavior, and problem-solving abilities. One effective technique for acing it is using the STAR format

**Situation** Describe the situation or context you faced. Provide enough background information to give the interviewer a good understanding of the scenario you are about to discuss. Remember to keep the focus on yourself and your role in the situation.
**Task** Outline the specific task or challenge you needed to address. What goal were you working towards? What obstacles or objectives did you need to overcome? 
**Action** This is the heart of your response. Describe the actions you took to address the situation and accomplish the task. Explain the steps you followed, highlighting your skills, decision-making abilities, and leadership qualities. You can use JDs to tailor this to bold that you're a perfect candidate. Be specific and emphasize the actions you personally undertook to highlight your individual contribution.
**Result** What were the results of your efforts? Focus on quantifiable achievements, such as increased productivity, cost savings, or positive feedback received. If possible, mention any recognition or accolades you received for your work. 

The STAR format can be expanded to STARI, with the **I** representing **Improvement**. 
**Improvement** Discuss the improvements you identified or the lessons you learned from the experience. Reflect on the challenges you faced and explain how you grew both personally and professionally. Discuss any adjustments you would make if faced with a similar situation in the future, demonstrating your ability to learn from your experiences.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

By using the STAR(I) format, you provide a structured and comprehensive response that showcases your abilities and accomplishments. Here are a few additional tips to keep in mind when using this format:

1. **Prepare examples:** Anticipate potential behavioral questions and prepare examples in advance. You can search for popular behavior questions and prepare based on these. Use Chat GPT to make it better, I think GPT can be very helpful on this. After any interview, if there are any questions that you haven't prepared, add them to your list, and prepare them as new examples.
2. **Focus on different competencies:** Behavioral questions can cover a wide range of competencies, such as problem-solving, leadership, teamwork, adaptability, and communication. Ensure you have examples that showcase different competencies to address a variety of questions.
3. **Practice storytelling:** Craft your responses as engaging stories. Use descriptive language (Chat GPT can help with this ðŸ˜‰) to paint a vivid picture of the situation, and make sure to convey your thought process and emotions throughout the narrative. Engaging storytelling can leave a lasting impression on the interviewer.
4. **Quantify when possible:** Whenever feasible, include quantifiable results in your responses. Numbers and metrics provide concrete evidence of your impact and make your accomplishments more compelling.

Remember, practice makes perfect. Rehearse your STAR(I) format responses, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and impact. Use mock interviews or ask a friend to play the role of the interviewer, providing feedback on your delivery and content.

By mastering the STAR format, you'll be well-equipped to handle behavioral interviews. 

Good luck!!

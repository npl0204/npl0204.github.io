It can be discouraging to see job postings that require experience when you're just starting, but, there are still several things you can do to enhance your resume and stand out to potential employers. This is something I did before I got my first interview invitation.

1. **Leverage your education**: Since we donâ€™t have any professional experience, your education will be a valuable asset. Highlight relevant coursework, projects, and academic achievements, and be specific about the techniques, tools, and technologies you've learned or worked.
2. **Part-time jobs**: Seek out positions where you can apply your skills and gain practical knowledge. For me, it is becoming Course or Research Assisstant. This helps show off soft skills and your enthusiasm for the field.
3. **Personal projects and open-source contributions**: Take the initiative to work on personal projects or contribute to open-source projects (*Kaggle*). Building your own data analysis or machine learning projects can showcase your abilities and demonstrate your passion for the subject. These projects not only provide practical experience but also demonstrate your ability to take initiative and work independently. Most of the time, interviewers ask me questions related to my personal projects and some even go to my GitHub and asked about things I didn't even show in my resume yet.
4. **Volunteer work and extracurricular activities**: Yeah, it's just helpful. And fun ðŸ˜—

Remember, building a strong resume takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you face rejections. Keep refining your skills, seeking opportunities to gain practical experience, and showcasing your passion for the field. 

Best of luck!

I want to share more about **research assistant** and shed light on the incredible opportunities it offers for resume building. Many students often overlook the advantages of being a research assistant, assuming it is solely for those pursuing research careers. However, I believe that a research assistantship can be an excellent starting point for any job seeker, regardless of their background or level of experience.

I have been fortunate enough to work with two professors who have provided me with invaluable experiences and learning opportunities (and now, for me, it's more than just that). One professor allowed me to collaborate on several ML projects, enabling me to gain practical skills and knowledge in the field. The other professor exposed me to the world of research, teaching me valuable insights and methodologies through her lab. The work I undertook with both professors greatly impressed some of my interviewers, as they recognized the significance and ask me several things about the projects I worked on.

Also, what makes research assistantships particularly valuable is that they don't require extensive prerequisites. In my case, I became a research assistant after studying DS for just four months. 

If you have any questions related to being a research assistant or would like to know more about my experiences, please feel free to ask. I highly recommend considering research assistantships as an excellent stepping stone in your career journey.

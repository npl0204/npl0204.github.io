## Overview
- Pre-processed and analyzed more than 60,000 records of 173 species (353 mushrooms per species) mushrooms with caps.
- Performed the classification models using Scikit-learn and Matplotlib and improved the accuracy score of a simple Logistic Regression from 85.82% to 99.96% with the SVM and 100% with the Neural Network model.
